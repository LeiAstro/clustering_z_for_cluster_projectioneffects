# Clustering_z_method
## Overview
This code measures projection effects in optically identified (redMaPPer) galaxy clusters using the clustering-redshift method. It cross-correlates cluster members (unknown sample) with a reference galaxy sample with spectroscopic redshifts, then jackknife-resamples the measurements to estimate covariances.
